# NVIM configuration

A big shoutout to Bryan Kegley and his [dotfiles](https://github.com/bkegley/dotfiles)!

They were a very good reference for me for switching my config to LUA.

He also made a very nice blog post about switching to LUA [here](https://bryankegley.me/posts/nvim-getting-started/).
